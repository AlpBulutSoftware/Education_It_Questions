    parseByte() returns primitive integer type (int),
    whereas valueOf() returns java.lang.

    Integer, which is the object representative of the integer.

    There are circumstances where you might want an Integer object,
    instead of a primitive type.

    Of course, another obvious difference is that valueOf() is an instance method
    whereas parseByte() is a static method.
